I've been in Tanzania for over a month now, but I've been so busy that it's gone by so quickly.

Before I left the states, I spent two days in Philadelphia meeting my fellow volunteers in our cohort. I learned there that we are the 89th volunteer group to serve in Tanzania. There were 27 of us in this cohort. Consisting of six health volunteers, five agricultural volunteers, and sixteen education volunteers. 

In the few days that I spent in Philly, I got to walk around downtown Philly, see the Liberty Bell and City Hall, and try a Philly cheesesteak. The morning before my first international flight, my cohort and I woke up to get on a chartered bus from Philly to the JFK airport. It was a fun drive, with lots of rain, but we didn't get a great of New York on our way up. Once we arrived at the JFK airport, we realized that we had arrived very early. We had to wait a few hours for the desk for Kenyan airlines to open and check our bags. Once we got through security, we ended up waiting for another few hours as our flight kept getting delayed and delayed. Finally, we were able to get on the flight several hours after the scheduled time.

The flight itself was loooooong. Unfortunately, my row had no power. Our televisions didn't work, and the reading lights or fans didn't turn on. I had the aisle seat next to Magnolia and Ryan, my roommate in Philly, had the window. We were offered to sit in a row that had power, but it only had two seats so we couldn't sit together. We opted to stay together and try to make it work. We had a very fun start to the flight due to alcoholic beverages being complimentary. One of the flight attendants had a very heavy hand with the beverages which was greatly appreciated. Unfortunately, Ryan’s table was also broken, and he ended up spilling one of his drinks all over himself. After they stopped severing drinks, we talked for a few hours much to the dismay of the people around us. Ultimately, my seatmates fell asleep for a while. I had a much harder time falling asleep since the seats were uncomfortable. We got to witness the sunrise from the airplane, which was a unique experience I wasn’t planning on seeing. But the windows didn’t have any hard-plastic shades, so it started getting very bright on our side of the plane as the sun rose more. The rest of the volunteers started getting up and walking around waiting out the last few hours of the flight.

After landing in Nairobi we had to run to our next flight to get to Dar es Salaam which was being held for us since we were late from leaving the JFK airport. It was a quick one-hour flight to get to Tanzania and we had almost completed our journey. Upon arrival in the Dar es Salaam airport, we were greeted by most of the Peace Corps staff who helped us through the customs and getting our bags.

We then took a quick drive to a Conference Center where we stayed for the rest of the week. At the conference center, I got acclimated to the time zone, had some medical trainings, and got an introduction to parts of Tanzanian culture. The most prominent aspect of their culture being how often they eat food. At the conference center, they fed us five times a day. Throughout the training days we have three breaks. A break around 10:30am called Chai break where small snacks and tea or coffee is served, a lunch break around 12:30pm, and a soda break around 3:30pm where they provide soda and more small snacks. In addition, to the breaks we were fed breakfast and dinner. I was very overwhelmed by how much food they were offering.

The main reason why this month has gone by so quickly is that I’ve been in trainings every Monday to Saturday starting at 8am and scheduled to end at 5pm. Luckily, we get off early some days and can have some time to relax in the afternoon.

After that first week of training in Dar es Salaam we left on Saturday morning to drive North to the Tanga region and met our host families for the rest of our pre-service training. All the volunteers got split up into groups of three or four volunteers and live nearby each other in a community-based training. My CBT consists of myself, Magnolia, Devin, and Joe. All of our host family houses are within a two-minute walk of each other.

My host family is quite large, but not everyone lives at the house. I am staying with a family of farmers. My host dad is called Anthony, my host mom is called Esther, and they have seven kids. Three of those kids live in the same city as us; Winfrieda, Thomas, and Neema. Winfrieda is a cook, Thomas works on the farm and has a shop, and Neema is a pharmacist. In addition to their seven kids they also have several grandchildren. Staying with me at the house is Irene, Nora, and Margaret who are all students at the local schools. 

Since we’ve been staying with our host families, Devin, Joe, Magnolia, and I would go to the local high school from Monday to Wednesday to learn from our teacher Selina, who teaches Swahili and introduces us to teaching skills. In addition to learning Swahili, we have observed other teachers in the classroom and start practicing teaching. On Thursday and Friday, we go to the local college to meet up with all the other volunteers for cohort-wide training on medical topics, safety and security, and policies.

I’ve been having a lot of fun being in Tanzania for this month, but it has been very tiring. Some things I’ve enjoyed about Tanzanian culture that differ from the American culture is the language, greetings, market, and transportation. 

The structure of Swahili is much different than English. In Swahili, verbs have a lot of forms that aren’t present in English. It is cool that Swahili allows the speaker to state the subject, object, tense, and action all in the same word. But is hard to remember all the way to conjugate verbs and is very mentally taxing. Additionally, greetings are very important in Tanzania. It is expected to say several greetings to your peers when walking by or stopping to talk. And there are lots of greetings to be said. Also, I’ve really enjoyed the market. In America, I’m used to price tags and being able to pay with my phone. But here in Tanzania it is much different. There are no price tags on anything, but some items do have set prices (if you know about them). A bottle of soda has a set price of 700 shillings but if you aren’t careful someone might charge you more. Further, since there aren’t any price tags foreigners are often charged a ‘mzungu price’ (foreigner price) due to perceived wealth. I have been enjoying haggling with shopkeepers for better prices and enjoy the more personal shopping experience. The transportation is much different than the way we commute in America. It is not common for people to have a car and drive themselves around. The buses are always full, and I often see 2-3 people on a motorcycle. The most unique aspect of the transportation here is the bijaji. A bijaji is a small three-wheeled car that acts as the taxi service here. The bijaji has unique steering system which looks like a steering system for a motorbike. Each bijaji is independently owned but they are abundant. Typically, a bijaji holds people passengers in the back with a driver in the front. But I have seen groups of up-to-six people pack into these tiny cars. It’s a fun transportation experience that I’m enjoying greatly. There’s also some haggling involved with finding a lower price to get where you want to go.

Next week marks the halfway point of my pre-service training which the three-month training I need to complete before moving to my site for two years.
