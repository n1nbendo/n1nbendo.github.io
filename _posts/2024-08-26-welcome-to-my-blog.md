On August 30th I will begin my journey to Tanzania to start serving as an education volunteer in the Peace Corps. I will be teaching math and science to high schoolers. For the first 3 months I will be in training to learn the language, culture, economy, and what they want me to teach. In October I will be assigned a site to live at and teach for 2 years. After spending 4 years in Arizona, I am hoping that I will get a position on the North side of the country where it is mountainous and cooler.

The above image is my path of flights I am taking to get to Tanzania. It will be my first time traveling internationally.

I plan to update this blog regularly.
